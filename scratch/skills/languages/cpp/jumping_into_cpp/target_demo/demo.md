# Demonstration File

The goal of this program is to be a very simple "starter" for some C++ based applications. The intent is to replace what I've been doing in Python with a standard C++ variant.

The program needs to:

- set up logging
- provide info out to the user
- parse command line arguments
- time the overall execution and report
- minimize the dependence on 3rd-party libraries

```bash
# set up google logging (?)
brew install glog


# GLOG_logtostderr=1 ./your_application

```
