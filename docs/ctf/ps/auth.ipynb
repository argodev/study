    "\n",
    "1. Load up Burp and start the embedded browser\n",
    "1. Connect to the URL provided and visit the `/login` page\n",
    "1. Attempt to log in with a random username/password\n",
    "1. View the `POST` request in Burp and send it to the intruder\n",
    "1. On the Positions tab, I cleared the `ยง` from the session cookie, leaving just the username and password positions\n",
    "1. Pasted the values from the list of candidate usernames (100 of them) into the Payload Options (simple list) and started the attack, paying attention to the response payload size.\n",
    "1. After the list ran through, I sorted by response length and noticed that one of them (username: `agenda`) had a different payload length. Looking at the response text, I noticed that it said _\"Incorrect password\"_. \n",
    "1. Returning to the positions page, I changed the username to a static value of `agenda`\n",
    "1. I cleared the payload list and pasted in the values from the candidate password list and then ran the attack\n",
    "1. Watching the response lengths, I again noticed taht one of them (password: `robert`) had a different length. Inspecting the response showed that user had logged in. \n",
    "1. With this information, I then returned to the browser, manually logged in with this information, and completed the challenge"
