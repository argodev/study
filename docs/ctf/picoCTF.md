# picoGym

Quoting from [their website](https://picoctf.org/):

> picoGym is a noncompetitive practice space where you can explore and solve challenges from previously released picoCTF competitions, find fresh never before revealed challenges, and build a knowledge base of cyber security skills in a safe environment.

> Whether you are a cyber security professional, competitive hacker or new to CTFs you will find interesting challenges in the picoGym that you can solve at your own pace. Team picoCTF will regularly update this challenge repository so visit the picoGym often.

I have used this site as a periodic refresher for skills that I need to remain sharp on and as a means of getting my head in the right "space". I've also used it as an introductory site for some aspiring cyber professionals.  On the pages linked below are my notes/findings/thoughts created while working through the exercises. They are written for my own benefit but they may be of use to others. 

!!! note
    Any time a sample command/output is listed on this page, the actual flag value will be replaced with `redacted_value`. This is done to ensure the "keys" aren't given away entirely should someone find these notes.
