    "This one takes a little more work than some of the other starter challenges. You are given a file `enc` and a little bit of code: `''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])` and asked to figure out what it is. To solve this you likely need to understand what the \"code\" is doing and what each command is. This appears to be a python one-liner that takes a variable `flag`, loops through it, manipulates it a bit, and spits it out. To get the flag back in 'plain text', we simply need to reverse the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "What appears to be happening in the provided python script is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* loop through the characters in `flag`, starting with the \"0th\", and skipping every other\n",
    "* take the ordinal value of the current character (int that maps to the ASCII code, e.g. 'a' becomes 97) and shift that value up by 8.\n",
    "* then take the next character in the flag and add it to the shifted value\n",
    "* output the resulting number as a string character.\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"undo\" the above, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* loop through the characters in enc _one at a time_\n",
    "* take the ordinal value of the current character\n",
    "* take the right-most 8 bits and convert that to a character (becomes the second letter)\n",
    "* shift the remaining number down 8, convert that to a character\n",
    "* output the results\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"verbose\" version of the reversing is shown in the following python function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decode(enc):\n",
    "    result=''\n",
    "    for i in range(0, len(enc)):\n",
    "        result += chr(ord(enc[i]) >> 8)\n",
    "        result += chr(ord(enc[i]) & 0xff)\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"one liner\" is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "''.join([chr(ord(enc[i]) >> 8) + chr(ord(enc[i]) & 0xff) for i in range(0, len(enc))])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you can tie it all together if you like as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cat enc | python3 -c \"import sys; enc=sys.stdin.read(); plain=''.join([chr(ord(enc[i]) >> 8) + chr(ord(enc[i]) & 0xff) for i in range(0, len(enc))]); print(plain)\"\n",

    "If we run the script, we see that there is some functionality that is protected by a license key. It doesn't take much guessing to assume we need to figure out the key, the result of which will either be the flag itself, or will unlock functionality that will render it. Looking into the code we see the function `check_key(user_key, bUsername_trial)` that looks quite promising. Digging into it and the surrounding code, we learn the following things:\n",

    "1. Loops through the next 8 characters to ensure they match particular indicies of a hash based on the trial username\n",
    "1. If everything else has passed, we are good to go.\n",
