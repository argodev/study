    "Here you are given a file `vuln.c` and told that there is a bot to trade \"stonks\" using AI and ML. It looks to be  service listening on `mercury.picoctf.net 16439` that you can interact with via netcat (`nc`). Probably need to spend some time looking at `vuln.c` to see what is going on...\n",

    "Well, I somewhat quickly assertained what was going on (format string vulnerability), but I then proved to myself that __I had abosolutely no idea how to actually exploit__ or take advantage of it. I spent *way* too much time trying to figure things out. \n",

    "I assumed that the flag would start with `picoCTF{` as most of them had, so I confirmed that I knew that the little-endian hex version of the start of that string was `6f636970`. I identified that portion in the byte string above, took from there to the end and dumped it into cyberchef. I then used a `swap endianness` tool complete with `from hex` and I had the flag.\n",
