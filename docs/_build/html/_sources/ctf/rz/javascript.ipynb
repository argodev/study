A little bit of reading shows that the expected username is `admin` and they attempt to be clever by encoding the password. Lots of ways to decode this, but if you copy that string and drop it into [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), you can drop the results into a variable, display them, and see that the expected password is `JavaScriptIsSecure`. Entering these values causes the page to present the flag which can then be entered to collect your points."
