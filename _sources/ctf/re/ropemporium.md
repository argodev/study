# ROP Emporium

This is not really a CTF, but I'm sticking my notes here for now. What this *is*, is an incredibly helpful tool for learning ROP and gaining some insight into various exploitation techniques. If any of this is interesting to you, I would quickly point you to the [ROP Emporium website](https://ropemporium.com/) where all of these exercises and challenges can be found. 

As always, the notes here are for my benefit and represent a working-log of my thoughts at the time that I wrote them. I rarely (read: never) go back and fix things that have been long-posted based on new findings, so take everything here with a healthy grain of salt.
