# PortSwigger Academy

PortSwigger Academy (https://portswigger.net/web-security/dashboard) is a collection of training materials (reading & videos) combined with hands-on-labs designed to help you learn how to "secure the web one step at a time". It covers a number of the most common vulnerabilities, helping you understand them, understand how to exploit them, and how they can be prevented. Best of all, they are all free. The tools *are* designed to work with/be supported by PortSwigger's flagship product, Burp Suite Professional, but you can utilize any number of other tools (curl/browsers/ZAP/etc). At the time I worked through these, I did not have access to a professional license, so I used the Burp Suite Community edition (free). Below are my notes written as I worked through the various challenges.
