# Study Topics

As part of my job, I’m expected to be an expert in a number of technical topics. The unfortunate reality is that I’m not really an expert... at anything. My mind appears to have a rather fixed amount of RAM and operates with an unfortunately strict adherence to the principles of a FIFO (first-in, first-out) queue. To offset this personal _feature_, I sometimes assemble collections of resources, tools, tutorials, etc. that help me remember the things I’m supposed to know and then use these to serve as a quick-access reference. This page contains links to a series of topics I’m currently exploring and attempting to deepen my understanding of.

The following are a number of "notebooks" that I have created and work on at various times as I do incremential dives into a topic. They should be consisered to be in a perpetual state of flux - if they are helpful in anyway to someone other than me, that is an added bonus.
